This is a vocabulary management app for English learners. The ultimate goal is to make this a runnable app that allows users to create and manage personalized vocabulary lists in their study of new words. 

To break this apart, we will achieve the following goals step-by-step. 

1) We will create a Word class, WordList Class and a VocabularyApp class. 

The Word class is responsible for managing a word. A user should be able to type in and review a word, its meanings and example usage in sentences. We will later allow users to import a word’s meaning, pronunciation, examples sentences etc from the Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary by using its API. 

The WordList manages individual word lists, such as MyAnatomyWords, MyGREWords, MyChemistryWords etc. Currently, I only added simple functions such as add/delete, but in future I hope to add functions to rank words by the difficulty of recognizing them to facilitate a users learning. 

The VocabularyApp class manages the usage of the app. A user should be able to manage word lists by opening a particular list, add/delete words, review words (TODO: devise a ranking method so that difficult words can be shown to user at higher frequency), or delete word lists. 

2) We will add GUI to Step 1). This is currently new to me, and I am still learning. But I envision some simple components, such as a main frame, buttons for user choice, text boxes for user input and output etc. 

3) We will make the little app runnable outside of Eclipse. Again, this is totally new to me. 

I hope anyone who is interested, especially new Java learners, to join this development! It will be great to build you resume as a programmer.
